ðŸ”´ Why Go ===>>
    1. Efficient compilation
    2. Efficient execution
    3. Ease of programming

ðŸ”´ Basic Go Syntax ===>>

    package main
  
    import "fmt"
  
    func main() {
  	fmt.Println("Hello, ðŸ˜‡")
    }

ðŸ”´ Statically typed ===>
    A statically typed language is a type of programming language in which 
    variable types are explicitly declared and determined at compile time 
    rather than at runtime. This means that the type of every variable is 
    known and checked by the compiler before the program is run, which can 
    help catch type-related errors early in the development process.
